# AI-Project-CIFAR10-Classification
# CNN Image Classification with LRP Visualization

## Project Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The key highlight is the integration of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to provide insights into what parts of the images influence the CNN's prediction decisions, enhancing interpretability.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install several dependencies. Ensure you have Python installed, then run the following commands in your terminal to set up the environment:

Bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
git clone https://github.com/RahilAhmed0/AI-Project-CIFAR10-Classification.git

Open the Project_3_.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Run the cells sequentially to view the model training process and the LRP results

Features
Model Training: Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Interpretability: Utilize LRP to generate heatmaps that visualize the influence of each part of the input image on the model's decision.
Evaluation: Assess model performance with accuracy metrics and visualize the decision process
